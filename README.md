## Description

My motivaton to building my portfolio was to see how far I got from the start of the bootcamp and to alos let employers see the apps I build
in the projects tabs. During the development, I encountered some difficulties with styling the images, but I solved my issue by reading the Bootstrap
documents and other online resources. Reading the bootstrap allowed my to learn some new things I didn't know before, making me have a better understanding
about bootstrap.
